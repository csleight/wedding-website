=== How We Met ===

Chris and Stephanie met for the first time in May 2011 through a mutual friend, Dave Pfau. They partnered up to play shuffleboard at SLO Brew, and dominated their opponents. When Dave asked Stephanie what she thought of Chris, she replied he's cute but he has a weird beard. At the time, Chris had a beard with no mustache which Stephanie thought looked a bit Amish.

In early December of 2011, during the SLO Holiday Parade, Chris met up with his friend Bobby at McCarthy's Irish Pub. Bobby was hanging out with a group of people that included, among others, Stephanie and her good friend Sarah Kraft (bridesmaid). Chris knew he had seen this beautiful girl before, but couldn't quite put his finger on where he recognized her from. He approached her and said "I feel like we've met before". Then it hit him, she was his shuffleboard partner.

"Do you know Dave Pfau?", Chris said.

"Yeah, we work together at Costco"

"I think you were my shuffle board partner."

"Oh yeah. We dominated that night.", Stephanie said.

Luckily for Chris, this time he was sporting a "sweet stash" leftover from Movember and a Marty McFly-like puffy vest-sweater thing that made him irresistable to Stephanie. She was totally into it.

When her friends wanted to ditch Bobby and head to a different bar, Stephanie said, "Can we at least keep the other one around, I think he's pretty cute." The group agreed, and they moved on to Buffalo.

Chris and Stephanie talked all night. When Chris worked up the courage to ask for Stephanie's phone number, she gave it to him and mentioned that she had a holiday work party the following evening. She asked if Chris would like to be her date, and he happily accepted.

=== Engagement Story ===

-
Some of Stephanie's fondest memories are of the times she spent backpacking in the Sierra Nevadas, just her and her dad. The Sierras also hold a special place in Chris's heart. Mammoth Lakes was his family's home away from home, and they vacationed there every year to snowboard and ski in the winter and to hike and fly-fish in the summer.

Chris took Stephanie on a backpacking trip into the Eastern Sierra Nevadas to celebrate her 29th birthday. They hiked 17 miles into the John Muir Wilderness before arriving at the Lake of the Lone Indian on their third night. The following morning Stephanie surprised Chris with two canned Mimosas she'd kept hidden in her pack, which they enjoyed as they watched the sun rise together from the saddle behind the Lake of the Lone Indian.

Chris had missed a perfect opportunity to pop the question earlier in the year when they went backpacking together in the Sierra Nevadas to celebrate Stephanies's 29th birthday. At this time, he hadn't yet purchased a ring. Stephanie surprised Chris with two canned Mimosas, which enjoyed as they watched the sun rise from the saddle of the Lake of the Lone Indian.


Chris had planned on popping the question on 12-13-14
