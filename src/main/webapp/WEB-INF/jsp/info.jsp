        <a>Parking & Transportation</a>
        <div>
          <p>Guest parking will be available just beyond the main entrance to the venue. A SafeRide shuttle will be provided to transport guests back to their nearby hotels or into downtown SLO for more celebrating. The shuttle service will run from 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM. Guests may leave their vehicles overnight and pick them up the following morning.</p>

          <p>Appetizers, an open bar with beer & wine, a buffet style dinner, and of course desert will be provided during the reception.</p>

        <a>Attire</a>
        <div>
          <p>Guest attire should be semi-formal. Guys, you can wear a button up and some slacks, but feel free to wear a suit if you really want to impress. Ladies, you look beautiful no matter what. Do your thing. Think August on the Central Coast; we expect it to be hot, with the possibility of cooling off in the evening (unless you're heating up the dance floor).</p>

      <li>
        <a>Cell Phones</a>
        <div>
          <p>We ask that guests refrain from using their cell phones or cameras during the ceremony. We will have professional photographers and videographers who've got you covered.</p>
