      <h2>How We Met</h2>
      <p>Chris and Stephanie met for the first time in May 2011 through a mutual friend, Dave Pfau. They partnered up to play shuffleboard at SLO Brew, and dominated their opponents. When Dave asked Stephanie what she thought of Chris, she replied he's cute but he has a weird beard. At the time, Chris had a beard with no mustache which Stephanie thought looked a bit Amish.</p>
      <p>In early December of 2011, during the SLO Holiday Parade, Chris met up with his friend Bobby at McCarthy's Irish Pub. Bobby was hanging out with a group of people that included, among others, Stephanie and her good friend Sarah Kraft (bridesmaid). Chris knew he had seen this beautiful girl before, but couldn't quite put his finger on where he recognized her from. He approached her and said "I feel like we've met before". Then it hit him, she was his shuffleboard partner.</p>
      <p>"Do you know Dave Pfau?", Chris said.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, we work together at Costco"</p>
      <p>"I think you were my shuffle board partner."</p>
      <p>"Oh yeah. We dominated that night.", Stephanie said.</p>
      <p>Luckily for Chris, this time he was sporting a "sweet stash" leftover from Movember and a Marty McFly-like puffy vest/sweatshirt that made him irresistable to Stephanie. She was totally into it.</p>
      <p>When her friends wanted to ditch Bobby and head to a different bar, Stephanie said, "Can we at least keep the other one around, I think he's pretty cute." The group agreed, and they moved on to Buffalo (Pub & Grill).</p>
      <p>Chris and Stephanie talked all night. When Chris worked up the courage to ask for Stephanie's phone number, she gave it to him and mentioned that she had a holiday work party the following evening. She asked if Chris would like to be her date, and he happily accepted.</p>
